				​<h3>Spooky Pack new DLC coming soon!</h3>
				<p>With the summer months behind us, we are gearing up for our Frontier Expo in October, during which we will be able to tell you more about some great new content making its way to Planet Coaster. The team has been so busy, our office has turned into a ghost town... creepy creatures are lurking in the corners, our desks are covered in cobwebs, and the lights seem to flicker every other minute... Strange, isn’t it?
				It must be the side effects from our brand-new SPOOKY PACK!

				That’s right: on September 25, 2017 we are releasing a spook-tacular Spooky Pack for you to get creative with. This is our newest paid content pack, specifically themed for those horror lovers and dark ride fanatics. The content pack contains two new powered tracked rides, a spooky themed wall set and static and animated attachments, special effects, shop fronts, path extras, doors and windows, fences, triggerable coaster doors, themed custom signs and facility signs, and themed hats for your Planco avatars. We’re also joined by a new entertainer, King Ghoster, who will happily haunt your parks and thrill your guests!

				The Hoax is a free-spinning haunted house ride with a tight track that twists and turns through each corner, and the Huntsman is Planet Coaster’s first ever motion platform ride which rotates on an axis and fits the theme perfectly. As always, the rides are fully customisable so it can fit your park just the way you want it to.

				In addition to this paid content pack, we’re also releasing a third coaster, the In-Descent, for everyone to enjoy for free! This is a rapid steel shuttle coaster not created for the faint-hearted... every Planet Coaster owner will automatically receive the In-Descent with this update on September 25 (it is NOT part of the Spooky content, it is a FREE coaster).

				The Planet Coaster Spooky Pack is completely optional for you to purchase – you can get it from Steam or the Frontier Store for €10,99. Please note that you need to have the Planet Coaster base game in order to download and play this extra content.

				We hope you’re excited about this hauntingly boo-tiful new Spooky Pack...
