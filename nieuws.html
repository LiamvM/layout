				​<h3>Planet Coaster 1.2.3 Update!</h3>
				<p>
					Hi everyone!

					Another small update for you just went live; aside from small tweaks, we are bringing you an all-new ride and the Go-Karts competition winning blueprint!

					The Pathos III is a pretty intense ride for its relatively small footprint; It’s twenty-three meters high, has three main rotating arms that also rotate around a central point and this is attached to a larger arm that is raised to almost 90 degrees, and also rotates! There are eight riders per arm that are suspended on each side. There are three rotation axis that spin the guests in all directions. This ride is only for the most hardcore thrill seeker!</p>
					<h3>New Ride Added in 1.1.4 Update</h3>
					<p>
						Hi coaster friends!

						Surprise, we’re bringing you another small update! The Planet Coaster development team have been working hard and wanted to indulge you with something new ahead of our bigger update in mid-late April.

						After our 1.1.3 update included localisation into Chinese and Korean, we are now also adding Japanese to that list. Konichiwa!

						What’s more, we also have a brand new flat ride for you! Say welcome to the Tri-Storm, an amusement park classic. It consists of three arms on a central column, with a star-shaped wheel at the end that holds seven gondolas. When the ride is activated, the central column rotates clockwise, while the star at the end of each arm rotates counterclockwise. Hydraulic cylinders then raise the arms to a 40° angle – at 25 feet tall and whipping around at decent speed, the Tri-Storm is fun for everyone.

						The team are still super busy working on features, improvements and bug fixes which will be implemented with our next major update in April. In the meantime, be sure to check out the PAX East livestreams on our official YouTube channel for a sneak peek into what has been happening behind the scenes.
